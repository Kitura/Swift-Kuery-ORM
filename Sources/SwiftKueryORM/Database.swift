     Create a Database instance which uses a single connection to perform each operation. The connection will remain open for the lifetime of the Database.
     It is safe for you to issue concurrent operations on the database: the ORM will ensure those operations are executed sequentially.
     This connection strategy provides lower latency requests, as a new connection does not need to be established for each operation, and has a small resource overhead. However, scalability is limited as all database operations are serialized.
     Below is example code which creates a connection and uses it to create a Database instance:
     ```swift
     var opts = [ConnectionOptions]()
     opts.append(ConnectionOptions.userName("myUser"))
     opts.append(ConnectionOptions.password("myPassword"))

     This connection strategy provides lower latency requests, as a new connection does not need to be established for each operation. You can choose between better performance or lower resource consumption by adjusting the number of connections in the pool.
     Below is an example code which creates a connection pool and uses it to create a Database instance:
     ```swift
     let connectionPool = PostgreSQLConnection.createPool(host: host, port: port, options: [.userName("myUser"), .password("myPassword")], poolOptions: ConnectionPoolOptions(initialCapacity: 5, maxCapacity: 10))

     Create a Database instance which uses short-lived connections that are generated on demand. A new Connection is created for every operation, and will be closed once the operation completes.
     This connection strategy allows for minimal resource consumption when idle, and allows multiple operations to be performed concurrently. However, the process of establishing a connection will increase the time taken to process each operation.
